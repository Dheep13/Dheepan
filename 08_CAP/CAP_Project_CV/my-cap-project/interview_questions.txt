cds init project-name


The package.json file has the metadata of your SAP Cloud Application Programming
Model project (Node.js environment), while the .cdsrc.json file has static settings
for your project.


When an SAP Cloud Application Programming Model project is built, the SAP
Cloud Application Programming Model framework creates database artifacts, or
the persistence model (tables, columns, indexes, views, etc.), by interpreting the
domain model. If a service is defined by reusing the domain model, then the
domain model will also result in OData artifacts (entity sets, properties, associations, etc.), as shown in Figure 3.9.
