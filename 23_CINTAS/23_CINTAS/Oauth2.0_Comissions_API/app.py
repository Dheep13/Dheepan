# Go to IAS Administration â†’ Applications and Create Commissions OIDC application.


# OpenID Connect (often abbreviated as OIDC) is a modern authentication protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization 
# framework. It allows third-party applications to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed 
# by an authorization server and to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.


# In essence, while OAuth 2.0 focuses on granting permissions, OpenID Connect focuses on user authentication,
#  providing apps with a reliable way to know who the user is and some basic information about them.


# In essence, the IAS server centralizes and streamlines identity and access management across cloud environments, 
# ensuring that the right users have the right access to the right resources, while also enhancing security and user experience
